Hybridization of Wind Farms Using Hybrid Power Plant Sizing Optimization
==========================================================================

**Abstract**

Hybrid power plants (HPPs) are a key potential player in the implementation of low-carbon energy systems because they combine
the benefits of renewable energy (RE) resources with the flexibility of battery storage; HPP are better prepared to operate on
fluctuating spot electricity markets over only wind or PV plants. In this article we study the concept of hybridizing an existing
wind power plants operating in the wind dominated Danish energy system. Because of the negative correlation between electricity
prices and wind generation in Denmark, it can be economically beneficial for a project to hybridize, i.e. to install PV and battery
storage mid-way in the lifetime of the project, to improve the revenues of a spot-market-operating plant and therefore increase
the value of energy.
