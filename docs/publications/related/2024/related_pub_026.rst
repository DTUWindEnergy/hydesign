Electrical Collection System Design Optimization for Hybrid Power Plants.
==========================================================================

**Abstract**

As a way of enhancing the profitability of renewable power plants (RPPs), this research explores the optimization of medium-voltage cable network layouts for Hybrid Power Plants (HPPs). In this work, HPPs combine wind and solar PV in the shared location with a single point of connection to the grid. Compared to traditional single-technology RPPs, HPPs have the potential to reduce costs by sharing the electrical infrastructure of the balance of the plants and the grid connection. The proposed optimization framework aims to minimize both cable investment costs and costs associated with curtailed energy due to overplanting or cable undersizing. The problem is modeled as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). Data clustering techniques are deployed to reduce computational efforts. Two optimization approaches are compared: one where cable layout is optimized separately for each technology, and another where the optimization considers both technologies simultaneously. The proposed methodology is applied to a case study in India as a proof of concept. Even though the precise numbers can differ from case to case, the results of the analyzed case study reveal 10- 15% of investment cost reductions, favoring the approach where both technologies are jointly considered. Sensitivity analysis highlights the critical role of careful data clustering when trying to capture characteristics of resources. The findings emphasize the importance of holistic optimization approaches when creating the electrical design of HPPs.
