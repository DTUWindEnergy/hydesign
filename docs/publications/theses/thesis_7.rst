Robustness of hybrid power plants under long-term weather and market fluctuations
================================================================================

**Abstract**

The impact of weather variations on the electricity market was simulated using Balmorel
for 30 weather years (1986-2015). These market conditions were then applied to test the
financial robustness of hybrid power plants (HPPs) in HyDesign.
Prices follow a seasonal pattern and are significantly influenced by weather, exhibiting a
negative correlation with solar and wind generation. Additionally, solar and wind resources
themselves are negatively correlated. When one resource (e.g., wind speed) decreases,
the other (e.g., solar irradiation) tends to increase, and vice versa.
HPPs demonstrate greater financial robustness over the long term, exhibiting less variation
and outperforming single-technology plants in terms of net present value (NPV). This
increased stability is primarily attributed to reduced production variability, greater participation
in energy markets, more efficient utilization of grid infrastructure, and lower costs
achieved through synergistic effects. The main driver behind the reduced variability is the
decreased dependency on a single renewable energy source.
Several HPP design configurations with varying shares of wind and solar capacity can
achieve comparable long-term financial performance and outperform single-technology
plants. Notably, each weather year may have its own optimal HPP design. However, planning
HPP designs based on multiple weather years is crucial, as the optimal configuration
can vary significantly over time, ranging from pure solar or wind setups to various hybrid
configurations. Over the long term, HPP designs consistently demonstrate stable and
robust financial performance.
However, this conclusion assumes sufficient wind and solar resources at the plant location
and the possibility of overplanting the point of connection (POC).
Under current battery technology costs and tested electricity market conditions, no batterybased
design was selected during optimization.
Not all potential aspects of HPPs have been explored, such as participation in various
electricity markets like automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve (aFRR) and Frequency
Containment Reserve (FCR), or all possible design configurations of HPPs, including
combinations of solar, wind, hydropower, biomass, and hydrogen production.
