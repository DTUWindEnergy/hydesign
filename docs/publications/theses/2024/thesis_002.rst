Techno-economical evaluation of different energy storage technologies for hybrid power plants
================================================================================

**Abstract**

The growing global demand for energy and the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
have driven the adoption of hybrid power plants (HPPs) that integrate renewable energy sources
(RES) with energy storage systems (ESSs). This thesis investigates the optimal design and
operation of islanded HPPs, focusing on two case studies: Ikaria in Greece and the Faroe
Islands. A model developed using HyDesign is employed to evaluate various ESSs, including
Li-ion batteries, Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES), Compressed Air Energy Storage
(CAES), Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), Gravity Energy Storage (GES), and Pumped
Thermal Energy Storage (PTES) and to model the operation of an islanded configuration. The
study assesses the technical and economic performance of these systems in off-grid applications,
taking into account the unique weather conditions and electrical grid demand load of each case
study. Moreover, a multi-objective function is applied to identify the optimal sizing of the
HPPs, with a focus on minimizing diesel generator usage and/or maximizing the net present
value (NPV) relative to capital expenditures. The trade-offs between these objectives are
thoroughly examined and discussed. The findings contribute to the broader goal of sustainable
energy development in remote communities, offering valuable insights into the deployment of
RES and ESS to achieve energy independence and environmental sustainability.
